# Landing Page Reframe Plan - Dorset Transfer Company

## The Problem
Current landing page focuses on "Travel Dorset with elegance" with Jurassic Coast imagery. The scenic tourism angle doesn't reflect what customers actually need: reliable transfers to airports, stations, and crucially - **cruise terminals**.

## The Opportunity
Southampton and Poole are **major global cruise hubs**. This isn't just "airport transfers like everyone else" - DTC is positioned at the heart of the UK's cruise industry. That's the edge.

## The Reframe
**FROM**: Scenic Dorset tourism experience
**TO**: "Your journey starts here" - premium transfers for travellers

**Messaging Rule**: Never say "escape from Dorset" or "gateway out of Dorset". Always positive framing centred on the customer's journey.

- Badge: "Est. 2025 - Dorset's Premier Transfer Service"
- Headline: "Travel Dorset with **elegance**"
- Subhead: "Reliable, comfortable transfers across the stunning Dorset coast..."

### Proposed
- Badge: "Est. 2025 - Dorset's Premier Transfer Service" (keep)

### Hero Key Points (Update)
- "All UK airports covered" (was: "All of Dorset covered")

## New Service Pillars (4 Cards)

### 2. Hourly Hire

## Journey Section Replacement

### Current Layout (to remove)
- "From arrival to destination" 3-step narrative with Dorset scenic images
- "Where we'll take you" circular thumbnails of Dorset landmarks

### Proposed: Destinations Carousel
Replace scenic Dorset imagery with a **carousel of departure types**:

| Slide | Image Concept | Headline | Copy |
|-------|---------------|----------|------|
| **Airports** | Terminal building / departure board / executive car at drop-off | "Airport Transfers" | "Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Southampton and all major UK airports" |
| **Cruise Terminals** | Cruise ship at Southampton / Poole harbour | "Cruise Transfers" | "Southampton and Poole - serving the world's leading cruise lines" |
| **Train Stations** | Platform / train / London terminus | "Rail Connections" | "London Waterloo, Bournemouth, Southampton Central and beyond" |

**Section Title**: "Where we'll take you"
**Section Subhead**: "Airports, cruise terminals, and rail stations across the UK"

### Why Cruise Gets Its Own Slide
Southampton is Europe's busiest cruise port. Poole serves expedition cruises and Channel Islands ferries. This is a **real competitive advantage** - not just another service offering.

*Note: Specific airport codes (LHR, LGW, BRS, SOU) for SEO metadata only, not visual content.*

---

## Image Replacement Strategy

### Images Needed
| Section | Image Concept | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Hero | Executive car / chauffeur / premium departure scene | Aspirational, professional |
| Carousel: Airports | Terminal building, departure board, or executive car at drop-off | Generic "airport" feel |
| Carousel: Cruise | Cruise ship at port / Southampton terminal | This is the differentiator - make it aspirational |
| Carousel: Rail | Platform / train / modern terminus | London Waterloo or similar |
| Corporate section | Business setting / professional handshake | For B2B partnership section |

### Remove Entirely
- All Dorset landmark images:
  - Durdle Door
  - Old Harry Rocks
  - Lulworth Cove
  - Corfe Castle
  - Shaftesbury Gold Hill
  - Kingston Lacy
  - Any other "scenic Dorset" imagery

### Image Sourcing
- **Unsplash/Pexels**: Airports, trains, generic travel
- **Cruise lines PR**: Southampton cruise terminal shots (many available free for editorial use)
- **Stock photography**: Premium service/corporate imagery

**Quality bar**: Professional, aspirational, clean. No stock-photo-cliche handshakes or pointing-at-laptops.
